# New Draft Empire Repo

### This was the best way I could think of replacing the old code with the new stuff that works.

## The REASON 
For the new repo is mainly because of the private keys I have set up on this repo work and the old repo has
wrong private keys.

[Portainer Dashboard](portainer.draftempire.win)

[pgAdmin Dashboard](pgadmin.draftempire.win)
